Simultaneously, global temperatures continue to rise, adding another layer of complexity to these existing problems. As a result, the issue becomes how can we sustain these civic resources in the face of climate change? Design for San Diego (D4SD) is a city-wide initiative centered on using human-centered design to develop solutions to these vexing civic challenges.",
